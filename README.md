- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mike Power. I'm finishing my MSc in Physics at Memorial University of Newfoundland and will start my PhD *somewhere* in September!
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in theoretical and computational magnetohydrodynamics, general plasma physics, and relativity. I'm new to GitHub, but I will start using it as a place to polish and upload the various codes and projects I've made over the years. I'm re-writing some old code as proper standalone libraries and uploading a clean (and parallelized) version of my "Dneg Wormhole Maker."
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning how to be a better code developer. I primarily work in FORTRAN (77 more often than not). Still, I am interested in object-oriented approaches to FORTRAN and getting better at writing clean, readable, and easy-to-use code. Computational physics codes, especially legacy codes, can often be challenging to work with, so throughout my career, I want to learn how to be as user-friendly as possible!
